            <h3 class="section-headings">What is Web Development?</h3>
            <p class="section-contents-texts">Web development refers to the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites or web applications. It encompasses several disciplines, from the structure and design of a webpage to the functionality and behavior of a web application.</p>

            <p class="section-contents-texts">There are two primary categories in web development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">
                    <p><strong>Frontend Development (Client Side):</strong> This refers to everything that users interact with directly on their web browser. It includes the layout, design, content structure, and interactivity of the website. Frontend developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless and engaging experience for users.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li class="list">
                    <p><strong>Backend Development (Server Side):</strong> This involves the part of the website that users don’t directly see but is responsible for handling the business logic, data management, and server-side operations. Backend development typically involves working with server-side languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java, as well as databases and APIs.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li class="list">
                    <p><strong>Full Stack Development:</strong> A full-stack developer is skilled in both frontend and backend development, enabling them to build entire applications from start to finish.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="section-contents-texts">In this course, we will focus primarily on Frontend Development, which is essential for creating interactive and visually appealing websites. The three fundamental technologies that you'll learn are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <h3 class="section-headings">The Three Pillars of Web development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">
                    <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong>HTML is the foundation of any website. It is the markup language used to structure the content of a webpage. Think of it as the skeleton of a website. HTML defines the different elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. Without HTML, there would be no content on the web!

                <li class="list">
                    <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> While HTML provides structure, CSS is used to add style and layout to the content. It controls how HTML elements are displayed, including aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS brings the visual appeal to your website, making it aesthetically pleasing and responsive across different devices.

                <li class="list">
